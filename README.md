**calculator

* It can evaluate expressions that contain the following operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `ror`
* It can evaluate expressions that contain parentheses
* It can handle numbers, variables, and nested expressions

The code is well-formatted and easy to read. It uses functions to organize the code and make it easier to maintain. The functions are well-named and easy to understand.

The code could be improved in a few ways:

* It could be more user-friendly by providing better error messages.
* It could be more efficient by using data structures to store the expression tree.
* It could be extended to support more features, such as variables and functions.

Overall, the code is well-written and easy to understand. It is a good example of how to implement a simple calculator in Python.

Here are some additional explanations about the code:

* The `calc_eval` function evaluates an expression tree by recursively calling itself on the operands of the expression.
* The `calc_apply` function applies an operator to a list of operands.
* The `read_eval_print_loop` function repeatedly prompts the user for an expression and then prints the result of evaluating the expression.
* The `calc_parse` function converts a string expression into an expression tree.
* The `tokenize` function tokenizes a string expression.
* The `analyze` function analyzes a tokenized expression and returns an expression tree.
* The `assert_non_empty` function raises an error if the given list is empty.
* The `analyze_token` function analyzes a token and returns its type and value.
* The `analyze_operands` function analyzes a list of tokens and returns a list of operands.
