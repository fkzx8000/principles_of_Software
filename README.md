# principles_of_Software

This repository contains two Python programs:

* `conversion_system.py` implements a conversion system for three currencies: Shekels, Dollars, and Euros.
* `calculator.py` implements a simple calculator that can evaluate expressions that contain the following operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `ror`.

## Conversion system

The `conversion_system.py` program defines three classes: `Shekel`, `Dollar`, and `Euro`. Each class represents a currency and has two attributes: `value`, which stores the value of the currency, and `__str__`, which returns a string representation of the currency. The `__add__` and `__sub__` methods implement the addition and subtraction operators for each currency.

The program also defines a dictionary `rates` that maps currency pairs to exchange rates. For example, the entry `('dollar', 'nis')` maps the pair `dollar` and `nis` to the exchange rate of 3.45.

The program can be used to convert between currencies. For example, the following code converts 100 Shekels to Dollars:

python
shekel = Shekel(100)
dollar = shekel.to_dollars()
print(dollar)
```

The output of the code is:

```
345.0


## Calculator

The `calculator.py` program defines several functions for evaluating expressions:

* `calc_eval` evaluates an expression tree.
* `calc_apply` applies an operator to a list of operands.
* `read_eval_print_loop` repeatedly prompts the user for an expression and then prints the result of evaluating the expression.
* `calc_parse` converts a string expression into an expression tree.
* `tokenize` tokenizes a string expression.
* `analyze` analyzes a tokenized expression and returns an expression tree.
* `assert_non_empty` raises an error if the given list is empty.
* `analyze_token` analyzes a token and returns its type and value.
* `analyze_operands` analyzes a list of tokens and returns a list of operands.

The program can be used to evaluate expressions. For example, the following code evaluates the expression `1 + 2 * 3`:

python
expression = "1 + 2 * 3"
tree = calc_parse(expression)
result = calc_eval(tree)
print(result)
```

The output of the code is:

## Principles of software engineering

The two programs in this repository demonstrate the following principles of software engineering:

* **Modularity:** The programs are divided into modules that each perform a specific task. This makes the programs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
* **Abstraction:** The programs use abstractions to hide the details of how things work. This makes the programs easier to use and understand.
* **Encapsulation:** The programs encapsulate data and functionality into objects. This makes the programs easier to maintain and extend.
* **Testability:** The programs are written in a way that makes them easy to test. This helps to ensure that the programs work correctly.
* **Reusability:** The programs are written in a way that makes them easy to reuse. This helps to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.

I hope this README file is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions.
